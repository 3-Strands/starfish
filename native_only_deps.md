# Plugins that only work on native (need wrapper for web)

- [x] `dart:io`
- [x] `path_provider`
- [x] `contacts_service`
- [x] `phone_number`
- [x] `permission_handler`
- [x] `open_file`
- [ ] Maybe `flutter_sms`? Is that used?
- [x] `telephony`


Notes:
* `flutter_hooks` is used in one place. Do we want this package just for the one use case?
